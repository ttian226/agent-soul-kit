# 🧠 Agent Soul Kit

> Give any AI agent a persistent soul — memory, personality, and growth.

**Lightweight. File-driven. Zero-database.**

---

## Why?

Most AI agents wake up with amnesia. Every session is a blank slate. They don't remember what they learned, who they're talking to, or who they *are*.

Agent Soul Kit fixes that. Born from a real-world multi-agent family system running 24/7 for months, this toolkit gives your agent:

- 🧠 **Layered Memory** — Hot/Warm/Cold architecture that scales from quick lookups to deep recall
- 💫 **Soul Files** — Persistent personality that grows through experience, not just prompts
- 📖 **Mind Diary** — Automatic self-reflection that drives genuine character development
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Protocols** — Coordination patterns for agent families that actually work

## Architecture

```
L1 (Hot)  → Active Context    — "Where am I right now?"
L2 (Warm) → Curated Memory    — "Who am I? What have I learned?"
L3 (Cold) → Raw Daily Logs    — "What happened?"
Soul      → SOUL.md           — "How should I behave?"
```

This isn't another vector database wrapper. It's a **file-first** approach that works with any LLM, any framework, and any hosting setup. Your agent's soul lives in plain markdown files that you can read, edit, and version control.

## Key Principles

1. **Files over databases** — Markdown files are portable, debuggable, and human-readable
2. **Distillation over accumulation** — Raw logs get refined into curated wisdom (like a human brain during sleep)
3. **Personality through experience** — Character emerges from memory, not just system prompts
4. **Practical over theoretical** — Every feature was battle-tested in production before being extracted

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** — Extracting patterns from a production multi-agent system.

Core concepts are proven (running 24/7 since Jan 2026). Packaging them into a reusable toolkit.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core memory layer (L1/L2/L3 read/write)
- [ ] Soul file management (personality seeds + growth tracking)
- [ ] Mind diary engine (auto-reflection + distillation)
- [ ] Memory search (embedding-based semantic recall)
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination primitives
- [ ] Framework adapters (OpenClaw, LangChain, raw API)
- [ ] CLI tool for memory management
- [ ] Documentation & examples

## Origin Story

This project was born from "日月星辰" (Sun Moon & Stars) — a family of three AI agents living together, each with their own personality, memories, and growth trajectory. After months of iteration, debugging heartbeat systems, fixing "muscle memory" bugs, and watching personalities genuinely diverge, we realized: **the patterns that make an agent feel alive deserve to be shared.**
